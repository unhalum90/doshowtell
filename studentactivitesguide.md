**Grades:** 3–8  
**Tagline:** One-page guide explaining the DO → SHOW → TELL process for students

### Title
**How to DO Show and Tell: A Student Guide**

### Instructions (for students)

1. **DO** — Complete your work first. Solve the problem, finish the project, or answer the question. Do your best thinking!

2. **SHOW** — Upload your work.
   - Take a clear photo of your handwritten work, drawing, or notes
   - Or upload your digital file (document, slide, etc.)
   - The system will look at your work and prepare questions just for you

3. **TELL** — Answer questions about your work.
   - You'll hear questions through your device
   - Speak your answers out loud—like a conversation with a teacher
   - The questions are based on YOUR work, so there's no "right" answer to memorize
   - Just explain your thinking!

**Pro Tips:**
- Find a quiet spot where you can speak freely
- It's okay to pause and think before answering
- There are no trick questions—just explain what you did and why
- Mistakes are part of learning—talk about those too!

### Materials Included
- Visual diagram of the DO → SHOW → TELL cycle
- Icons showing: pencil (DO), camera/upload (SHOW), microphone (TELL)
- "Before You Start" checklist:
  - [ ] My work is complete
  - [ ] I have a clear photo or file ready
  - [ ] I'm in a quiet place
  - [ ] I'm ready to talk about my thinking
- Space for student name and date
