**Audience:** Teachers new to oral assessment  
**Tagline:** Detailed week-by-week plan for rolling out DO Show and Tell

### Title
**The 4-Week Transition: From Traditional Assessment to DO Show and Tell**

### Instructions (for teachers)
This guide walks you through a scaffolded rollout of oral assessment. Each week builds student skills progressively—matching your assessment to what you've taught at each Bloom's level.

**The Golden Rule:** Don't assess at Level 5 (Evaluate) if you taught at Level 1-2 (Remember). Build progressively.

### Materials Included

---

#### **Week 1: Building the Foundation**
**Goal:** Introduce the format, build comfort, eliminate tech anxiety  
**Bloom's Level:** 1-2 (Remember/Understand)

| Activity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Explain the Process (10 min)** | Tell students what oral assessment is and WHY it matters: "This shows YOUR thinking—something AI can't fake." |
| **Model Good Responses** | Play 2-3 example recordings. Show what "great" sounds like. |
| **Practice Assessment (No Grade)** | 2-3 simple questions: "Explain the main idea of...", "Describe what we learned about..." |
| **Debrief** | Ask: "What felt easy? What was tricky?" Address tech issues. |

**Assessment Design:**
- Questions at Remember/Understand level
- 30-45 second response time
- NO follow-up questions (keep it simple)
- Practice Mode only (no grade)

**Sample Prompts:**
- "Explain the three branches of government."
- "Describe the water cycle in your own words."
- "What is the main idea of Chapter 3?"

---

#### **Week 2: Building Skills**
**Goal:** Add depth, practice citing evidence, low-stakes graded assessment  
**Bloom's Level:** 3-4 (Apply/Analyze)

| Activity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Teach Evidence Integration** | Model how to naturally reference your work while explaining. |
| **Think-Aloud Demo** | Teacher models analyzing a sample artifact aloud. |
| **Formative Assessment (5-10%)** | 2-3 questions requiring analysis. Students upload work artifact. |
| **Provide Feedback** | Use AI-generated scores + add personal comments to struggling students. |

**Assessment Design:**
- Questions at Apply/Analyze level
- 60-75 second response time
- 1 optional follow-up question enabled
- Low-stakes grade (5-10% of unit)

**Sample Prompts:**
- "Explain your problem-solving strategy. Why did you approach it this way?"
- "Compare the two characters we studied. What do they have in common?"
- "Look at your lab data. What pattern do you see and why?"

---

#### **Week 3: Increasing Rigor**
**Goal:** Enable Socratic follow-ups, build reasoning stamina  
**Bloom's Level:** 4-5 (Analyze/Evaluate)

| Activity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Teach Responding to Follow-Ups** | Explain: "The system may ask you to go deeper. That's normal!" |
| **Partner Practice** | Students practice explaining their work to a partner before recording. |
| **Formative Assessment (10-15%)** | 2-3 questions with Socratic follow-ups enabled. |
| **Compare Week 2 vs 3** | Celebrate improvement. Note where students still struggle. |

**Assessment Design:**
- Questions at Analyze/Evaluate level
- 75-90 second response time
- Socratic follow-ups ENABLED
- Medium-stakes grade (10-15%)

**Sample Prompts:**
- "Evaluate which solution is better and defend your choice."
- "A classmate says your conclusion is wrong. How would you respond?"
- "What's the strongest piece of evidence in your work? Why?"

---

#### **Week 4: Summative Success**
**Goal:** Full oral assessment with artifacts and follow-ups  
**Bloom's Level:** 5-6 (Evaluate/Create)

| Activity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Review Success Strategies** | Students recall what works: "Take your time. Reference your work. It's okay to think." |
| **Goal Setting** | Each student writes: "One thing I want to do well in this assessment..." |
| **Summative Assessment (20-25%)** | Multi-question assessment with full Socratic dialogue. |
| **Celebrate & Reflect** | Debrief: "What did you learn about your own thinking?" |

**Assessment Design:**
- Questions at Evaluate/Create level
- 90-120 second response time per question
- Full Socratic follow-ups enabled
- Summative grade (20-25%)

**Sample Prompts:**
- "Defend your thesis using evidence from multiple sources."
- "Explain how you would solve this problem differently if X changed."
- "Synthesize what we learned this unit. What's the biggest takeaway?"

---

#### **Time Investment Summary**

| Week | Prep Time | Class Time | Review Time |
|------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Week 1 | 2-3 hours | 15-20 min | 15 min |
| Week 2 | 2 hours | 20 min | 30 min |
| Week 3 | 1.5 hours | 15 min | 30 min |
| Week 4 | 2 hours | 15 min | 45 min |
| **Total** | **7.5-8.5 hrs (first time)** | **~1 hr** | **2 hrs** |

*After your first unit, prep time drops to 3-4 hours total—you have templates and know the process.*

---

#### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
❌ Skipping Practice Mode in Week 1  
❌ Using your essay prompts verbatim (too complex for oral)  
❌ Enabling follow-ups before Week 3  
❌ Grading oral responses like written essays  
❌ Forgetting to celebrate improvement

| Referenced their work | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
| Answered follow-ups | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |

**Quick Score:** _____ / 15

---

#### **Notes for Oral Assessment Grading**
- **"Ums" and pauses are normal.** Don't penalize natural speech patterns—listen for thinking, not polish.
- **Oral ≠ Written.** Students won't speak in complete, grammatical sentences. That's okay.
- **Focus on reasoning.** Can they explain WHY, not just WHAT?
- **Listen for growth.** Compare Week 4 to Week 1—celebrate progress.

**[School Letterhead / Teacher Header]**

**Dear Families,**

I'm excited to share a new approach we're using in our classroom this year called **DO Show and Tell**.

**What is it?**

You probably remember "show and tell" from elementary school—when students brought in an object and talked about it in front of the class. DO Show and Tell brings that same idea back, but with an important addition: the **DO**.

Here's how it works:

1. **DO** — Your child completes an assignment: solves a problem, writes a response, creates a project, or answers questions.

2. **SHOW** — Your child takes a photo of their work (or uploads a digital file) to our platform.

3. **TELL** — Our platform asks your child personalized questions about their work, and they answer by speaking aloud. It's like a conversation about their thinking.

**Why are we doing this?**

In today's world, students can easily use AI tools to complete written assignments without truly understanding the material. But they can't fake thinking in a real-time conversation.

DO Show and Tell helps us:
- ✅ Verify that your child truly understands the content
- ✅ Build their verbal reasoning skills (essential for jobs, college, life!)
- ✅ Give them a "voice" to explain their thinking—not just bubble in answers
- ✅ Provide faster, more personalized feedback

**What does this mean for your child?**

- They'll complete work as usual, then talk about it
- They'll practice explaining their thinking clearly
- They may feel nervous at first—that's normal! We do lots of practice rounds before any graded work
- Over time, they'll become more confident speakers and thinkers

**How can you support at home?**

- **Ask "Why did you do it that way?"** when your child does homework
- **Listen without interrupting** as they explain their thinking
- **Encourage practice speaking aloud** about schoolwork
- **Reassure them** that "ums" and pauses are okay—we're listening for thinking, not perfection

**Questions?**

I'm happy to discuss! Feel free to email me or schedule a time to chat. You can also learn more about this approach at **DoShowAndTell.com**.

Thank you for partnering with me to help your child become a stronger thinker and communicator.

Warm regards,

**[Teacher Name]**  
**[Subject/Grade]**

### **Template for Creating Your Own Prompts**

| Element | Your Prompt |
|---------|-------------|
| **Subject/Topic** | |
| **Grade Level** | |

| **Artifact Required** | |
| **Oral Prompt** | |
| **Follow-up Question 1** | |
| **Follow-up Question 2** | |

---

#### **Prompt Design Tips:**
1. **Keep prompts focused.** One clear question, not multi-part.
2. **Require artifact reference.** Students should look at and mention their work.
3. **Use open-ended language.** "Explain how..." not "What is the answer to..."
4. **Plan 2-3 follow-ups.** These reveal depth.
5. **Match Bloom's level.** Don't ask Level 5 questions in Week 1.
