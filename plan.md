# DoShowAndTell.com: Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Owner:** Eric Chamberlin  
**Target Launch:** February 2026 (4 weeks)

---

## Vision Statement

**DoShowAndTell.com is the home of a pedagogical movement that brings the most effective formative assessment practice from early elementary education back to K-8 classrooms—made sustainable through modern technology.**

We provide the free methodology, research, implementation frameworks, and community that enable teachers to assess authentic student understanding efficiently. We are pedagogy-first, platform-agnostic, and teacher-led.

SayVeritas is referenced throughout as "the platform purpose-built for this methodology," but the methodology itself is free and open.

---

## Strategic Positioning

### What This Is
- A **movement site** (not a product site)
- A **pedagogical resource** (free content, not gated)
- A **community hub** (teacher-contributed examples, shared learning)
- A **thought leadership platform** (research-backed, practitioner-led)

### What This Is NOT
- A SayVeritas marketing site (that's sayveritas.com)
- A software tutorial (that's in-app help)
- A paid course or membership (everything is free)
- A vendor-driven ed-tech pitch

### The Business Model
- Site is 100% free
- Revenue comes from SayVeritas conversions (linked throughout)
- Teachers discover methodology → implement manually → realize need for platform → convert to SayVeritas
- Long-term: Book deals, speaking fees, PD consulting (Eric's personal brand)

---

## Target Audience

### Primary: K-8 Classroom Teachers
- **K-2:** Need simple, low-pressure oral assessment methods
- **3-5:** Want to extend show and tell beyond primary years
- **6-8:** Need rigorous formative assessment that isn't written work

**Psychographics:**
- Overwhelmed by grading workload
- Frustrated with AI-generated homework
- Want authentic understanding, not compliance
- Value pedagogy over technology
- Trust other teachers more than vendors

### Secondary: School Administrators
- Curriculum directors looking for assessment innovation
- Principals supporting teacher workload reduction
- Academic deans seeking academic integrity solutions

### Tertiary: Parents & Researchers
- Parents understanding their child's assessment methods
- Researchers studying oral assessment effectiveness
- Ed policy folks exploring alternatives to standardized testing

---

## Core Messaging Framework

### The Problem (Relatable)
1. **Show and tell worked** in early elementary—one of our most effective assessments
2. **We stopped around 3rd grade** because it didn't scale (30 students × 5 minutes = 2.5 hours)
3. **We lost something critical** when we abandoned it: the ability to hear students articulate their thinking

### The Solution (Simple)
**DO Show and Tell brings it back—at every grade level—using tools that make it sustainable.**

**The "DO" signals the difference:**
- Old show and tell: bring a toy, talk about it (low effort)
- **DO Show and Tell:** complete rigorous thinking work, defend it with evidence (high effort)

### The Three Steps (Memorable)
1. **DO** the work (handwritten thinking: notes, annotations, diagrams, problem-solving)
2. **SHOW** your work (photo upload: proof you did it)
3. **TELL** what you learned (90-second voice: proof you understand it)

### The Promise (Aspirational)
**Students develop oral reasoning skills. Teachers get authentic formative feedback. Everyone saves time.**

---

## Site Structure (MVP)

### Homepage
**Hero Section:**
- Headline: "DO Show and Tell: The Assessment We Never Should Have Stopped Using (K-8)"
- Subheadline: "Students complete thinking work by hand. They show their work (photo). They tell what they learned (voice). Teachers assess understanding in minutes, not hours."
- CTA: "Learn the Methodology" (scrolls down) + "See the Platform" (→ SayVeritas)
- Hero image: Student with handwritten notes + voice recording icon

**3-Part Explainer (Scroll Sections):**
```
[Icon: Pencil] DO the Work
Complete your thinking work however you learn best: 
handwritten notes, diagrams, annotations, problem-solving.

[Icon: Camera] SHOW Your Work  
Take a photo. Upload it. This is your receipt—proof you did the work.

[Icon: Voice] TELL What You Learned
Record 90 seconds explaining your thinking: 
What did you figure out? Where did you struggle? How did you solve it?
```

**Why This Works:**
- Authentic understanding (can't fake both artifact + oral explanation)
- Student ownership (they did the thinking, not AI)
- Teacher efficiency (30 minutes to review class patterns vs. 5 hours grading)
- Formative feedback (see who's getting it, who's stuck, what to reteach tomorrow)

**CTA: "Get Started" → /getting-started**

---

### Core Pages (MVP - 10 pages)

#### 1. `/what-is-it` - The Pedagogy
**Sections:**
- **The History:** Show and tell in early elementary—why it worked
- **Why We Stopped:** The logistics problem (time × students)
- **Why Bring It Back:** What we lost (oral reasoning, formative insight, student voice)
- **The Modern Solution:** Technology makes it scalable
- **Research Backing:** Constructivism (Piaget/Vygotsky), metacognition (Flavell), formative assessment (Black & Wiliam), authentic assessment (Wiggins)

**Key Quote:**
> "Show and tell was never broken. We just couldn't sustain it. Now we can."

---

#### 2. `/how-it-works` - The Method
**Student Workflow:**
```
Step 1: DO
- Complete the thinking work (read, annotate, problem-solve, take notes)
- Use whatever method helps you think: handwritten notes, sketches, diagrams
- This is YOUR thinking time—messy is fine, mistakes are expected

Step 2: SHOW  
- Take a photo of your physical work
- Upload the photo (proof you did the work)
- Bring the original to class (verification)

Step 3: TELL
- Record 90 seconds of voice explanation
- "Here's what I figured out..."
- "Here's where I struggled..."
- "This is how I solved it..."
```

**Teacher Workflow:**
```
Step 1: Assign the Work
- Give students the thinking task
- Explain DO → SHOW → TELL expectations
- Set submission deadline

Step 2: Review Patterns
- Look at artifacts (did students do thorough work?)
- Listen to defenses at 1.5x speed
- Identify class patterns: who's getting it, who's stuck, what misconceptions exist

Step 3: Act on Insights
- Reteach tomorrow what students missed
- Provide targeted feedback
- Grade based on understanding (revealed in TELL), not compliance
```

**Time Comparison:**
| Traditional | DO Show and Tell |
|-------------|------------------|
| Collect 30 notebooks | Review 30 photos |
| Read 30 responses (5-6 hours) | Listen to 30 defenses at 1.5x (30 minutes) |
| Grade in isolation | Identify patterns |
| Return 2 weeks later | Feedback next class |

- **Artifacts:** More detailed notes, annotations, multi-step problem-solving
- **Defense:** 60 seconds, guided frameworks (RACE: Restate, Answer, Cite, Explain)
- **Example:** "Read this article and annotate for main idea. Tell me the author's message and where you found it."

**6-8: Deepening Analysis**
- **Focus:** Critical thinking, evaluating claims, defending positions
- **Artifacts:** Sophisticated annotations, comparative notes, argument planning
- **Defense:** 90 seconds, open-ended with follow-up questions

- Use heavy scaffolding (sentence stems, frameworks)
- Make it no-grade or extra credit
- Goal: Build confidence with academic content

**Week 3: Increase Rigor**
- Current unit content
- Less scaffolding, more independence
- Low-stakes grade (5-10% weight)
- Goal: Students demonstrate actual learning

**Week 4: Full Implementation**
- Regular part of classroom routine
- Students know the expectations
- Teacher reviews efficiently
- Goal: Sustainable formative assessment

**Ongoing:**
- Weekly or bi-weekly (find your rhythm)
- Mix high-stakes and low-stakes

---

#### 6. `/diy-guide` - Manual Implementation

**"You Don't Need Software to Do This"**

**How to Implement Without a Platform:**

**For Photo Submission:**
- Option 1: Google Form with image upload field
- Option 2: Google Drive folder (students upload with naming convention: LastName_FirstName_Assignment.jpg)
- Option 3: Email submission (manageable for small classes)

**For Voice Recording:**
- Option 1: Email voice memos (iPhone: Voice Memos app → share via email)
- Option 2: Google Drive (upload audio file)
- Option 3: Flipgrid (RIP - being discontinued)
- Option 4: VoiceThread (paid, but works)

**For Review:**
- Create spreadsheet to track submissions
- Open each photo, listen to each voice file
- Take notes on patterns
- Time estimate: 5-6 hours per assignment cycle for 30 students

**When You Need a Platform:**
- You're doing this weekly
- You have 100+ students
- You want automated transcription
- You want pattern detection (AI identifies common misconceptions)
- You need grade export to LMS

→ **That's when you consider SayVeritas** (link)

#### 10. `/about` - About This Movement

**Who Created This:**
"Hi, I'm Eric Chamberlin. I've been a teacher, administrator, and director of academics for 25 years across public, private, international, and online schools. I saw how show and tell transformed learning in early elementary—and I couldn't understand why we stopped.

So I brought it back. And I built the tools to make it sustainable. This site is my gift to the profession. The methodology is free. The research is open. The community is collaborative.

If you want the platform I built to scale this, check out SayVeritas. But you don't need it to get started. You just need to believe that students can—and should—articulate their thinking."

   - **Recommendation:** Not yet. Start with "Share your story" form. Launch forum/Slack in Phase 2 when there's critical mass.

3. **Video content at launch?**
   - **Recommendation:** Not required. Text + images sufficient for MVP. Add video testimonials post-launch as you collect them.

4. **Pricing transparency?**
   - **Recommendation:** Link to SayVeritas pricing page. Don't duplicate pricing info on DoShowAndTell.com (they're separate properties).

## Appendix: Sample Copy

### Homepage Hero (Final Copy)

**Headline:**  
DO Show and Tell: It Worked in 2nd Grade. It Works in 8th Grade.

**Subheadline:**  
The most effective formative assessment from early elementary—brought back for K-8 classrooms. Made sustainable with modern tools.

**Body:**  
Remember show and tell? Students brought something they made or learned. They showed it to the class. They explained it in their own words. You could instantly tell who understood.

**Then we stopped.** Around 3rd grade. Not because it stopped working—but because 30 students × 5 minutes didn't fit in a 45-minute period.

**We're bringing it back.** Same pedagogy. New format.

**Students DO the work** (handwritten notes, annotations, problem-solving).  
**Students SHOW their work** (photo upload).  
**Students TELL what they learned** (90-second voice explanation).

Teachers see understanding in 30 minutes, not 5 hours.
